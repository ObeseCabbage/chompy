# Sabot

Sabot is a Node.js bot used to obtain anonymous statistics about the interactions on a **Discord** server.

### Features

* Can serve multiple channels and guilds at once.
* Supports the MongoDB database.
* Does not count messages sent by bots.

### Commands

* ```!message_count [-S]``` Displays the amount of messages that have been sent.
* ```!popular_words [-S]``` Displays the 10 most popular words that have been sent.
